# Introduction
Why I should learn Rust? My friend I have the answer... Why not? hehe just kidding, learn more about it in this book.

## Why Rust?
Rust is a system programming language which has three essential pillars, that are: **Safety**, **Concurrency** and **Speed**. 

**Before starting learning... Is rust OOP?** ðŸ¤” 

Yes...or no? That's difficulty to say, because Rust has OOP approaches but in his ways.

> [*Using this definition, Rust is object-oriented: structs and enums have data, and impl blocks provide methods on structs and enums. 
> Even though structs and enums with methods aren't called objects, they provide the same functionality, according to the Gang of 
> Four's definition of objects.*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-01-what-is-oo.html#:~:text=Using%20this%20definition%2C%20Rust%20is,of%20Four's%20definition%20of%20objects.)

In rust we don't have Interfaces or Classes, rather than that we use Traits and Structs. Structs implements(impl) traits like class
with interfaces, but it's a little bit more complex than that, we will talk about that in next pages, to be specific in Traits and Structs topic.

What you need to know is that the rust community isn't too bothered about whether or not it's OOP, just that many users consider it and many don't.
What matters is that rust is a multiparadigm language, where many instructions for OOP and functional programming are provided. And that is SO COOL.

## Anyway Let's talk about the THREE PILLARS
Rust was fully developed thinking about these three pillars. You'll notice that everything in Rust is guaranteed by following the three pillars on this page.

### First One! Security
#### Memory Security
#### Garbage Collector

### Concurrency
#### Threading

### Speed
